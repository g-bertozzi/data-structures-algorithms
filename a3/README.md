Data Strctures and Algorithms- Assignment 3

## Description

This assignment involves comparing three algorithms for counting the number of inversions in an array. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these algorithms using three different datasets and record their running times.

### Steps:

1. **Array Creation**: 
   - **Array 1**: Contains 1000 elements starting from 1 and ending at 1000.
   - **Array 2**: Contains 1000 elements in reverse order, starting from 1000 and ending at 1.
   - **Array 3**: Contains 1000 random integers between 1 and 1000 (with repetitions allowed).

2. **Algorithms**:
   - The three provided algorithms count the number of inversions in each dataset.
   - The running times for each algorithm are stored separately.

3. **Histogram**:
   - After running the algorithms, the running times are represented in a histogram.

### Materials Used:
- `Random` class for generating random numbers.
- `System.currentTimeMillis()` for recording execution time.

### Requirements:
- **Files**: 
  - 3 Java files with the provided inversion counting algorithms.
  - 1 Java file that calls the algorithms and stores the running times.
  - A PDF describing the approach, along with a histogram and screenshots of the program results.
